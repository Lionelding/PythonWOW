As a machine learning developer/researcher, I encountered many python related questions from time to time. 
The majority of them are straightforward, but some are subtle to understand, and hard to be applied properly in real practise. 
During the process for searching answers, I realized that it usually becomes super clear if I write them down with my own examples and understanding. 

This repository serves as my notes to track of these questions.
I usually start from the problem statement raised from a real world example, and goes to the reasons behind it.  
I would be also very happy if this can help you.
